# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
  
## Part 1: SQL Drills  
•	There is a file for each drill that contain both the ask and the answer   
•	There is also one file called Completed DRILLS that contains all the drill in one SQL Script including the corresponding answer.  
## Part 2: SQL Case, Surfs Up!
### •	Step 1 Climate Analysis and Exploration   
  - Prepare SQLAlchemy 
  - Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data. 
  - Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame   
  - Plot result
#### Station Analysis  
  - Design a query to calculate the total number of stations 
  - Design a query to find the most active stations
  - Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS)   
  - Plot result as a histogram   
### •	Step 2 Climate App  
  - Design a Flask API based on the queries that have been developed 
### •	Step 3 Data Analyses  
#### Temperature Analysis  I  
  - Identify the average temperature in June and December at all stations across all available years in the dataset
#### Temperature Analysis  II  
  - Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS)   
  - Calculate the total amount of rainfall per weather station  
  - Create a query that will calculate the daily normals
  - Plot the daily normals as an area plot with `stacked=False`
